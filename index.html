    <!-- Our story -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>The Ridgewood Reservoir at Highland Park, which sits between Brooklyn and Queens, once provided the City of Brooklyn with water, allowing it to take off as an industrial force in the late 1800s.</p>
      <p>Today, the decomissioned reservoir is a different kind of hubâ€” one where visitors can find moments to appreciate both history and nature. And it can be enjoyed as such for years to come with its new Department of Environmental Protection
        designation as a protected wetland. </p>
      <p>Local environmental and historical groups pushed for the status of the natural space, which earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places last year.</p>
      <p>The reservoir and surrounding green space is home to approximately 150 bird species, such as the endangered short-eared owl. </p>
      <p>"The Newton Historical Society is proud to have been a part of this amazing effort," the group's president Christina Wilkinson <a href="http://www.newtownhistorical.org/ridgewood-reservoir.html">wrote</a> in an announcement. "We believe
        that environmentalism and historic preservation go hand-in-hand."</p>
